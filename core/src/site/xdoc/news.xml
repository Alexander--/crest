                        <p><strong>CRest</strong> v2.0.0 RC1 has been released! Changes include new features, general API improvements and more popular libraries support.</p>
                        <p>This release candidate is supposed to be production ready, but can be subject to changes/fixes in function of the users feedback, and should be quickly followed either by a RC2 or a final v2.0.0 release.</p>
                        <p>The major change in this release is the partial support for the <a href="http://jsr311.java.net">JAX-RS v1.1</a> annotation API, which means you can now feed <strong>CRest</strong> with a REST interface annotated with the <a href="./annotations/jaxrs.html">supported JAX-RS annotations</a>.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately this release is not retro-compatible with the previous one, but the migration from the old to the new API is quite straightforward.</p>
                        <p>Please refer to the <a href="./changes-report.html">change report</a> page for a more detailed list of the changes this release comes with.</p>
