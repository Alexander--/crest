Maven

    CRest is a mavenized project that lives in the Maven Central repository. Given that your project is also mavenized, all you have to do is to declare a new dependency in your POM, as follow:

+-----
    <project>
        ...
        <dependencies>
            ...
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.codegist.crest</groupId>
                <artifactId>codegist-crest</artifactId>
                <version>1.0.1</version>
            </dependency>
            ...
        </dependencies>
        ...
    </project>
