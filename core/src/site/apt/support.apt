Support

    By default <<CRest>> doesn't rely on any library third party library.

    However, since <<CRest>> is based on mechanism such as dynamic proxies, HTTP calls, marshalling, it offers support for some popular third party libraries.

    This support is made easily accessible through the <<<CRestBuilder>>> methods.
